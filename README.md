üìä Data Analysis

Daikibo's tech team has converted all telemetry data collected from the 4 factories of the company:

Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)
Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 min. Daikibo has been collecting this data for 1 month (May 2021) and they've just shared this data in the form of a single JSON file. The reason this client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:

In which location did machines break the most?
What are the machines that broke most often in that location?
By completing this task, I learned how to use the famous Analytics tool Tableau to build an interactive dashboard that helps the Daikibo's tech team to answer their questions.

üë®‚Äçüíª Excel 

The Forensic Tech team has built an algorithm to quantify ‚Äúlevel of gender pay equality‚Äù for most job roles within the company, in all company locations. Our Forensics lead thinks it would be a great idea for you to finish the job.
We have processed all data on employee compensation and generated an Excel file (Equality Table.xlsx, available in the Resources) containing 3 columns:

Factory


Job Role
Equality Score (integer; ranging between -100 and +100; 0 is ideal)
Here is your task:

Create a 4th column (Equality class), classifying the equality score into 3 types:
Fair (+-10)
Unfair (<-10 AND >10)
Highly Discriminative (<-20 AND >20)
Examples:

10 ‚Üí Fair
-9 ‚Üí Unfair
-30 ‚Üí Highly DiscriminativeThe Forensic Tech team has built an algorithm to quantify ‚Äúlevel of gender pay equality‚Äù for most job roles within the company, in all company locations. Our Forensics lead thinks it would be a great idea for you to finish the job.
